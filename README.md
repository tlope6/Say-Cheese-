Say Cheese! is a creative, gesture-controlled desktop application built with Python, PyQt, and OpenCV that allows users to interact with a live camera feed using hand movements and facial expressions instead of traditional mouse clicks.

The application displays a real-time webcam feed embedded directly within a custom graphical interface. Users can trigger actions—such as capturing photos, activating visual effects, or switching modes—by performing hand gestures or face-based interactions detected through computer vision.

All interactions are logged into a local SQLite database, recording gesture types, timestamps, and system responses. This data can later be visualized or analyzed to understand user behavior and interaction patterns.

Designed as both a technical and artistic project, Say Cheese! explores the intersection of human-computer interaction, creative coding, and machine perception, demonstrating how cameras can become expressive input devices rather than passive sensors.

Currently in progress so stay in tune....
